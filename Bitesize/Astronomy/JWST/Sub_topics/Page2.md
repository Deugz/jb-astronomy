NIRCam: From Data to Ice Maps: Initial Results from **IceAge**, A JWST Early Release Science program (Zak Smith Talk 14/02/2023)

**Notes**

Results can't be shared

- cf Image from paper (Star forming region)

- Include image

Digg deeper than ever before.

## Data 

3 different instruments 

- NIRSPEC (2.5 - 5 Âµ)
- Nircam - Zak contribution
- Miri

**Absorption** from ice (from background sources)



- Ice chemical composition

### Why study ice

Origin of life - How do the molecules that create life came to be

Ice second most comon molecule in the Universe (after H2).

Dust Burk et al 2010 check suutarinnen 2017

```{note}

- Slit vs slitless spectroscopy (more effective but lots of difficulties arising from it)

```

Visual extinction (A<sub>v</sub>) = density

### Ice maps

Akari Suutarinen 2017

The denser the region, the more ice there is

### Zak Ice map

75 sources

#### How are they produced

Photutils Source extraction package (Python)

Zooniverse project / Machine learning bit (not understood)

#### How much ice is there

Model the background 

2nd order polynomial (star background  + visual extinction)

-> Optical depth spectra - Integrate area below the curve -> column density -> Ice maps

Water CO and CO2 Ice maps

### Conclusions

- Region < 100AU probed

- Ice not evenly distributed

- Different species dominates

- Dangling OH is probed (First time) **Ice is porous**

French colleague with models -> Who ?




Lots of **things produced today that will be used long term** - What how, by who ?
