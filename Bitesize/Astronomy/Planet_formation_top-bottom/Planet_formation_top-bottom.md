Everything we use that has not been grown either contains or relies on materials that have been sourced by a geologist. In this free course you will be introduced to some key geological processes that impact everyday life, as you discover the link between volcanoes and your mobile phone, and find out why tiny marine wildlife is at the core of the plastics industry. You will learn about the various types of rock, and explore how, where and why different rocks and natural resources form across the Earth. You will also look at some of the environmental and sustainability considerations that geologists need to take into account when extracting and processing these resources.

### Definitions

### Let's go

History of our Solar System is recorded in the <strong>isotopic variability</strong> of the chemical elements. In 1903, *Rutherford and Soddy* unveil radioactive transformations (commonly use nowaday for age dating) but it is 10 years later in 1913 that Soddy introduce the term <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Definition">isotope</span>, experimentaly confirmed the same year by J.J Thompson.

```{note}
- Theory of what is an isotope
```

First quantitative framework for describing the thermodynamics of isotopic exchange reactions rest on two key papers:
- Urey 1947 [link](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1039/JR9470000562)
- Bigeleison and Mayer 1947
