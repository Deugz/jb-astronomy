<p class="emphase"> For us <strong>all</strong></p>

The boom of the *accademic pubmlishing business* resulted in the creation of a multitude of scientific journals, increasing the divisions and compartimentation of the various research fields.

Our research is often very narrow, however the problematics to whome our progress can have an impact is incredibely broad.

A single place where every researchers can bring his own piece to resolve the "Big Picture" puzzle.

<p class="emphase2">Reconciliate Art with Science</p>


<p class="emphase"> <strong>Art</strong> is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. The natural world is of a <strong>phenomenal beauty</strong> and sciences goal is to describe this world so why not use artistic tools to teach ?</p>

<h4> <strong>Compiling knowledge </strong></h4>

::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item}
:columns: 10

Like a DJ would do to build his set. A DJ set is a collection of individual tracks assembled in a coherent way to create a specific *vibe*. I found that I build knowledge incrementaly, and it is usefull for me to have a place to take notes about what I learn, and implement the ressources I discover along the way. Similarily to a DJ, that improves his setes with all the gems he found during his journey, this website is a place where I intend to implement all the <strong>teaching ressources</strong> I found and develop during my carreer as a researcher (those are my tracks).

As members of academia, we have a lot to share with each others and with the world.


***

<p class="emphase2">Innovative Teaching</p>

- Free from curriculums

- Increase public engagement



## Why ?


<p class="emphase"> Despite a curious and inquisitive mind, I have never been a studious and full-blown student ...  </p>
  
I can see 3 main reasons for that:   
- First, I have only encountered a fraction of good teachers and all of them had their hands tied by very <strong>strict curriculum</strong> they had to follow. 
- Secondly, most of the time I spent in a classroom have been to religiously listening and copying learning material, which was an incredibely boring activity as well as a complete loss of time. 
- Last but not least, the finality of learning was less about discovering new concepts and having the right tools to describe them, but just to fill your brain with information that had to be spit out during exams so pupils could be ranked and funneled out of Accademia.     

Teaching is an important part of the life of a researcher and I believe it is one of the best and most important job that one can do. However, it is a task that is often controlled and managed by heavy administrative bodies. I think every researcher should be given the chance to share his knowledge in a creative and appealing fashion (that is terribly lacking in academia). 



## How it works ?


Divided into the main scientific disciplines

traffic light system

### Collaboration

I cannot stress how important <strong>collaboration</strong> is for science.

### Audiences

Insert fish diagrams


## Contribute


```{note}

Link to collaboration workflow
