This website is a place where I intend to implement all the <strong>teaching ressources</strong> I found during my carreer as a researcher.

Same as a DJ improving his stes with all the gems he found during his journey.

### Why ?


I build knowledge incrementaly, and I find usefull to have a place to take notes about what I learn, and implement ressources that I discover along the way.

It is also a good method to implement seeds for future collaborations/contributions as your understanding increase and you push the boundaries.
