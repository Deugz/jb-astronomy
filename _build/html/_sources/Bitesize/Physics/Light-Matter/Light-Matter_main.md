According to classical electromagnetism, electromagnetic waves exhibit several key properties:

- **Wave Nature**: Electromagnetic waves are characterized by their wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν), related by the equation c = λν, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Classical physics treats electromagnetic waves as continuous, sinusoidal oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.

- **Superposition**: Electromagnetic waves obey the principle of superposition, meaning that when multiple waves overlap, the resulting wave is the sum of their individual contributions. This allows for interference and the formation of complex wave patterns.

- **Polarization**: Electromagnetic waves can be polarized, which refers to the orientation of the electric field vector. The polarization can be linear, circular, or elliptical, depending on the motion of the electric field.

- **Propagation**: Classical physics describes electromagnetic waves as propagating through space in a transverse manner, meaning that the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

- **Energy and Intensity**: Classical physics associates energy with electromagnetic waves. The energy carried by an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude and is spread out over the wavefront. The intensity of the wave is related to the energy flux per unit area and depends on the square of the amplitude.

Classical electromagnetism provides a good description of many macroscopic phenomena involving electromagnetic radiation, such as the behavior of light in optical systems, the interaction of light with materials, and the propagation of radio waves. However, at the microscopic level and in certain extreme conditions, quantum mechanics is required to fully understand the behavior of electromagnetic radiation.


#### Quantum

Quantum physics, specifically quantum electrodynamics (QED), provides a more detailed and accurate description of electromagnetic radiation compared to classical physics. According to quantum physics, electromagnetic radiation consists of discrete packets of energy called photons. The quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation is based on the principles of wave-particle duality and quantization of energy.

Key aspects of how quantum physics describes electromagnetic radiation are as follows:

- **Particle-like Nature**: Quantum physics views electromagnetic radiation as consisting of individual particles called photons. Photons are quanta of energy and carry both wave-like and particle-like properties. Each photon has an energy proportional to its frequency (E = hν), where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency of the photon.

- **Energy Quantization**: The energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized, meaning it can only exist in discrete energy levels determined by the frequency of the radiation. Higher frequencies correspond to higher energy photons.

- **Wave-like Nature**: Despite being particles, photons also exhibit wave-like properties. The wave nature of photons is described by a mathematical function called the wavefunction or wave packet. The wavefunction describes the probability distribution of finding a photon at different positions and times.

- **Superposition and Interference**: Like other quantum particles, photons can exist in superposition states, where they can be in multiple states simultaneously. This allows for interference effects, where the probability amplitudes of different possible paths of a photon can interfere constructively or destructively, leading to observable effects.

- **Quantized Polarization**: Quantum physics also considers the quantization of polarization. Photons can have different polarizations, such as vertical, horizontal, or circular. The polarization state of a photon is determined by its wavefunction.

- **Absorption and Emission**: Quantum physics describes the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter in terms of absorption and emission of photons. When a photon is absorbed by an atom or molecule, it can elevate an electron to a higher energy level. Conversely, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon.

- **Quantum Field Theory**: Quantum electrodynamics treats electromagnetic radiation as an interaction between photons and charged particles using quantum field theory. It provides a framework for calculating and understanding the behavior of photons and their interactions with matter.

Quantum physics provides a more comprehensive understanding of electromagnetic radiation, especially in scenarios involving interactions at the atomic and subatomic levels. It accurately describes phenomena such as the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and the emission and absorption spectra of atoms and molecules, which cannot be fully explained by classical physics.
