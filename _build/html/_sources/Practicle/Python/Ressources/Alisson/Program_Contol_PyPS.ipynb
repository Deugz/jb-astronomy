    "The first instruction (line 1) is an `assignment`: the computer evaluates the expression to the right of the assignment (=) and stores the result in the variable (`result`) on the left of the assignment. Each piece of data that is needed by a program must be stored in a variable. Translating Python to English, the assignment states ‘let result be the sum of 3 and 7’. We could call the variable anything we want, such as `R` or `sum_of_two_numbers`, but the first of these is rather too short to be meaningful, and the second is rather long to type in. So a compromise for the variable name that's not too long, not too short, and which means something to anyone reading the program is usually the best option.\n",

    "1. The comma separates the two things to be printed, in the same way that we use commas in English to enumerate two, three, or more things.\n",
    "2. Text is written between double quotes, which are not printed themselves. In Python, a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes is called a *string*. (Note that single quotes can also be used and you may see them employed in Python programs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These details are important once you start writing your own programs. Computers are not as smart and accommodating as human readers; at the slightest spelling mistake (like `pint` instead of `print`) or missing punctuation (like forgetting the comma or double quotes), the computer will give up on running your code and will display an error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, most error messages are rather cryptic. Therefore, it’s a good idea to get used to them by noting any error messages that you get and what caused them, so that you understand what might be wrong when faced with similar error messages as you develop your own programs. This is what you will do in the following exercise. "

Notice that you do not need to use complete words for variable names, but it’s best to use a name that at least reminds you of what the variable represents. Note also that Python cares about capitalisation in variable names, so `weight`, `Weight` and `WEIGHT` would be three different variables. \n",

    "More generally, you should always choose the names of any variables carefully. Ideally, variable names should be self-explanatory and unambiguous. \n",

    "Finally, notice the # symbol. On a given line, this indicates that whatever follows is a comment. The kernel ignores comments; they are simply notes made by the programmer to clarify any finer points about the working of the code. Comments come in very handy if the author (or someone else) needs to change the code later. In fact, different *components* of the program appear in different colours. It is usual for programming and editing software to include this type of *syntax highlighting* because it makes it easier for humans to read (unfortunately, the default highlighting colours are not always designed with colour-blind people in mind; fortunately, in many cases these defaults can be changed). \n",
    "\n",
    "In case you're wondering, any blank lines are simply ignored by Python. Like comments, you may put blank lines in where you wish, in order to help make your program more readable. Similarly, spaces within an expression are often disregarded. So line 3 above may be written as `weight = totmass * acc` (with spaces, as here), or without spaces as `weight=totmass*acc`.  Both of these will give the same result, although the spaces are preferred as they make the expression more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to be a little more precise with the weight calculation. You may know that the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth varies with latitude. As a first approximation of this variation, the acceleration can be set to $9.79\\text{ m s}^{−2}$ for latitudes less than $45^\\text{o}$, and to $9.82\\text{ m s}^{−2}$ for latitudes of $45^\\text{o}$ or more (these apply north and south of the equator). This then, is a very simple example of a calculation that is performed in different ways depending on some condition. In order to carry out the calculation properly, we need to select the appropriate route through the instructions, and so we use a process of *selection*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will need one more variable to store the latitude and some new instructions to handle both cases.\n",

This is then followed (line 2) by a statement that sets the total cumulative mass (`totmass`) to zero before we start adding the masses of the individual items. Such a step is called *initialisation* - it sets the initial value of `totmass`. Variables that have not been initialised properly are a common source of errors in computer programs.  \n",
