<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Introduction </u></strong></h3>

The natural world is of a phenomenal beauty. How can creature as complex as Human-being came to be ?    

## Why ?

<p class="emphase2">Reconciliate Art with Science</p>

<p class="emphase">The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power</p>


Using artistic routine to touch the emotions and unleash curiosity.

I build knowledge incrementaly, and I find usefull to have a place to take notes about what I learn, and implement ressources that I discover along the way.

It is also a good method to implement seeds for future collaborations/contributions as your understanding increase and you push the boundaries.


As members of academia, we have a lot to share with each others and with the world.

## How it works ?


Divided into the main scientific disciplines

### Collaboration

I cannot stress how important <strong>collaboration</strong> is for science.

### Audiences
