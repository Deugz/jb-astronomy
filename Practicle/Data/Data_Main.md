### Types of error

#### Mistakes 

- Identify and avoid

#### Human errors 

- reading scales, pressing stopwatch 


#### Instrumental limitations 

- accuracy of scales, instruments, precision of stopwatch 

#### External effects 

- Temperature effects, electrical interferences 

#### Statistical fluctuations 

- Finite sample from large population (eg raindrops to characterise rainfall)

#### Unrepresentative samples 

- Only see largest raindrops 


### Error and uncertainity

Measured property x generally has an error delta x'

True value is x'

x = x' + deltax'

neither x' nor delta x' is


#### Types of error 

##### Exact properties 

##### Statistical properties 

No exact value so average must be defined

##### Random errors

Repeated measurments give slightly different results due to uncertainties 

##### Systematic errors

Result from error in measurment technique or external factor

```{note}

Scale fatcor error (scale not well calibrated)

```

#### Uncertainties in a single properties 

- Assignment of uncertainties is often a matter of judgement
- Use common sense


**Standard deviation**

sigma number 

```{note}

Use standard deviation with deposition value at 20K

```


### Combining errors



### Random events




### Graphs
