   abstract = {<p> Direct D-H exchange in radicals is investigated in a quasi-uniform flow employing chirped-pulse millimeter-wave spectroscopy. Inspired by the H-atom catalyzed isomerization of C <sub>3</sub> H <sub>2</sub> reported in our previous study, D-atom reactions with the propargyl (C <sub>3</sub> H <sub>3</sub> ) radical and its photoproducts were investigated. We observed very efficient D-atom enrichment in the photoproducts through an analogous process of D addition/H elimination to C <sub>3</sub> H <sub>2</sub> isomers occurring at 40 K or below. Cyclic C <sub>3</sub> HD is the only deuterated isomer observed, consistent with the expected addition/elimination yielding the lowest energy product. The other expected addition/elimination product, deuterated propargyl, is not directly detected, although its presence is inferred by the observations in the latter part of the flow. There, in the high-density region of the flow, we observed both isotopomers of singly deuterated propyne attributed to stabilization of the H+C <sub>3</sub> H <sub>2</sub> D or D+C <sub>3</sub> H <sub>3</sub> adducts. The implications of these observations for the deuterium fractionation of hydrocarbon radicals in astrochemical environments is discussed with the support of a monodeuterated chemical kinetic model. </p>},

   abstract = {• An internal shock caused by particle collisions reduces the radial extent of the model plume, resulting in a decrease in plume density as detected by a simulated flyby by as much as three orders of magnitude. • This can halve the area of the Europan surface over which plumes can be differentiated from the H 2 O atmosphere (region of separability), making plume detection more difficult. • We recommend Europa flybys pass below the plume canopy altitude, e.g. 300 km, to maximise the chance of detecting a plume. • Lowering the altitude of the flyby by 100km can increase the chance of detecting a plume by increasing the region of separability by as much as 32%. • If the flyby passes close to the plume, a neutral mass spectrometer could resolve the structure of the canopy shock-allowing us to probe the plume physics. In-situ detection of Europa's water plumes is harder than previously thought. Abstract Europa's subsurface ocean is a potential candidate for life in the outer solar system. It is thought that plumes may exist which eject ocean material out into space, which may be detected by a spacecraft flyby. Previous work on the feasibility of these detections has assumed a collisionless model of the plume particles. New models of the plumes including particle collisions have shown that a shock can develop in the plume interior as rising particles collide with particles falling back to the moon's surface, limiting the plume's altitude. These models also assume a Laval nozzle-like vent which results in a colder plume source temperature than in previous studies, further limiting the plume's extent. We investigate to what degree the limited extent of the shocked plumes reduces the ability of the JUICE spacecraft to detect plume H 2 O molecules. Results show that the region over Europa's surface within which plumes would be separable from the H 2 O atmosphere by JUICE (the region of separability) is reduced by up to a half with the collisional model compared to the collisionless model. Putative plume sources which are on the border of the region of separability for the collisionless model cannot be separated from the atmosphere when the shock is considered for a mass flux case of 100 kg s −1. Increasing the flyby altitude by 100 km such that the spacecraft passes above the shock canopy results in a reduction in region of separability by a third, whilst decreasing the flyby altitude by 100 km increases the region of separability by the same amount. We recommend flybys pass through or as close to the shock as possible to sample the most high-density region. If the spacecraft flies close to the shock, the structure of the plume could be resolvable using the neutral mass spectrometer on JUICE, allowing us to test models of the plume physics and understand the underlying physics of Europa's plumes. As the altitude of the shock is uncertain and dependent on unpredictable plume parameters, we recommend flybys be lowered where possible to reduce the risk of passing above the shock and losing detection coverage, density and duration.},

   abstract = {Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir of the volatile elements that link chemical processes in dark, interstellar clouds with the formation of planets and composition of their atmospheres. The initial ice composition is set in the cold, dense parts of molecular clouds, prior to the onset of star formation. With the exquisite sensitivity of JWST, this critical stage of ice evolution is now accessible for detailed study. Here we show the first results of the Early Release Science program "Ice Age" that reveal the rich composition of these dense cloud ices. Weak ices, including, $^\{13\}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, $^\{13\}$CO, OCS, and COMs functional groups are now detected along two pre-stellar lines of sight. The $^\{12\}$CO$_2$ ice profile indicates modest growth of the icy grains. Column densities of the major and minor ice species indicate that ices contribute between 2 and 19% of the bulk budgets of the key C, O, N, and S elements. Our results suggest that the formation of simple and complex molecules could begin early in a water-ice rich environment.},

   abstract = {Earth’s origins are challenging to elucidate, given the lack of surviving terrestrial geology from the first 500 Myr of the Solar System. In this Review, we discuss breakthroughs in geochemistry and theoretical modelling that have advanced understanding of Earth accretion. Theory holds that solar nebula dust particles stuck together to form pebbles, concentrations of which gravitationally collapsed into ∼100-km-sized planetesimals, which in turn accreted to yield planets. Isotopic variations in meteorites indicate that pebbles formed within the first 100 kyr of the Solar System, planetesimals melted and differentiated within a few 100 kyr, and Mars accreted quickly within 5 Myr. Earth’s growth was more protracted, with >98% of its mass being accreted by the time of the Moon-forming Giant Impact at ∼70–120 Myr. Earth is more enriched in s-process nuclides than chondritic meteorites, with a chemical composition affected by condensation, melting and loss. Early volatiles acquired from the nebula largely escaped, with the remnant volatiles being diluted by main-stage Earth accretion, accompanied by loss of nitrogen to the core and/or space. Areas for further research should include assessing mixing during large collisions and investigating the origin of very early mantle isotopic heterogeneities, which might indicate mass transfer from core to mantle over time.},

   abstract = {This work presents a study of water mobility on interstellar dust grain analogues at temperatures as low as 18 K. The work indicates that water forms pure domains rather than covering the entire grain, thereby leaving bare dust grain surfaces available on which other molecules can adsorb as well as themselves providing surfaces for further adsorption from the interstellar gas. Water ice is the most abundant solid in the Universe. Understanding the formation, structure and multiplicity of physicochemical roles for water ice in the cold, dense interstellar environments in which it is predominantly observed is a crucial quest for astrochemistry as these are regions active in star and planet formation. Intuitively, we would expect the mobility of water molecules deposited or synthesised on dust grain surfaces at temperatures below 50 K to be very limited. This work delves into the thermally-activated mobility of H 2 O molecules on model interstellar grain surfaces. The energy required to initiate this process is studied by reflection–absorption infrared spectroscopy of small quantities of water on amorphous silica and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces as the surface is annealed. Strongly non-Arrhenius behaviour is observed with an activation energy of 2 kJ mol −1 on the silica surface below 25 K and 0 kJ mol −1 on both surfaces between 25 and 100 K. The astrophysical implication of these results is that on timescales shorter than that estimated for the formation of a complete monolayer of water ice on a grain, aggregation of water ice will result in a non-uniform coating of water, hence leaving bare grain surface exposed. Other molecules can thus be formed or adsorbed on this bare surface. },
